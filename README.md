# AI Assignments (Compact Reference Implementations)

1) State-space Search (8-Puzzle)
- **File**: `eight_puzzle.py`
- Implements **BFS**, **DFS**, **UCS**, and **A\*** (with
**Manhattan** and **Linear-Conflict** heuristics).
- Runs 5 random solvable start states, prints path cost, nodes
expanded, and wall time.
- Heuristic notes included (admissible + consistent).
**Run**
##```bash##
python eight_puzzle.py

2) Heuristic Search Plots
eight_puzzle.py also prints averages for UCS vs A* (Manhattan & Linear-Conflict).
(If you want matplotlib plots, you can easily add a small bar chart using the printed averages.)

3) Logical Agent: Wumpus World (4×4)
● File: wumpus_world.py
● A propositional KB with classic rules:
  ○ ¬B(x,y) ⇒ all neighbors safe
  ○ B(x,y) ⇒ some neighbor is pit + candidate shrinking; singleton ⇒ pit
● Agent explores only proven-safe cells, logs derived sentences, grabs gold if found, and
goes back to (1,1).
Run
python wumpus_world.py

4) End-to-End ML Pipeline (Regression)
● File: ml_regression.py
● Dataset: California Housing from scikit-learn (auto-fetch). If download is blocked, it
falls back to the built-in Diabetes dataset.
● Steps: tiny EDA → train/test split → preprocessing (StandardScaler) → Linear
Regression → RMSE/MAE→ export model_card.json and two small PNG charts.

Run
python ml_regression.py

Environment
python >= 3.9
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

### Notes on what to turn in
- 8-puzzle: include the console table of results (5 cases × {BFS, DFS,
UCS, A*-Manh, A*-LC}) and a short paragraph interpreting why A*
dominates UCS on nodes/time.
- Heuristics: add the admissibility/consistency sketch provided above.
- Wumpus: paste the **Derived sentences** log to show the KB reasoning
steps that led to safe cells and pit identification.
- Regression: attach `model_card.json` plus the reported **RMSE/MAE**
and the two figures (`target_hist.png`, `true_vs_pred.png`).
